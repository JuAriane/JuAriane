# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Juliana], a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a [Junior Software Developer] at [Evlos4u]. With over [8] months of experience in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects and explore different technologies.

## ðŸš€ Expertise

## Specialization

I am deeply passionate about technology, problem solving and I am continually looking for new challenges that will lead me to learn and grow. I am currently finishing my degree in Systems Analysis and Development, complementing my academic knowledge with practical experience in the field of software development.

I started my journey as an intern at my current company and, within six months, I was promoted to Junior Programmer. During this period, I am developing skills as a fullstack programmer to work on various technologies and frameworks.

My knowledge covers front-end and back-end development, which allows me to approach projects with a broad perspective. I enjoy creating and planning solutions, always with the aim of achieving the highest quality results. My work is driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous improvement, both personally and professionally.
